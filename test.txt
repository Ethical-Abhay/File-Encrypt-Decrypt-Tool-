I am currently pursuing a career in cyber security
because I am deeply passionate about protecting digital systems 
and data from cyber threats. I have a strong interest in understanding 
how hackers think and how to build strong defenses against them.
 I constantly keep myself updated with the latest trends and 
 technologies in cyber security to improve my skills.
My goal is to become a skilled cyber security expert 
 who can help organizations stay safe in todayâ€™s digital world.
  Outside of work, I enjoy learning new technologies
   and solving problems related to computer security
